TODO

1. Add a parameter to the constructor \_\_init\_\_(self, ____) and use the parameter in place of 'space' as the key press that activates the drawing

2. Draw five of your objects in a row without changing the class, just the driver code

3. Add an instance variable, self.hasDrawn, that is initially false. Set it true when the object is drawn. If self.hasDrawn is true, don't draw the object again
